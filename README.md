# FLIP – F**k the CLIP

Tired of wasting time clicking through a maze of broken pages, ugly CSS, and confusing menus just to check your schedule or download a PDF?

So were we.

**FLIP** is the student-built, one-click interface that replaces your university's digital disaster (aka CLIP) with something that *actually works*. It's fast. It's automated. And it's powered by pure frustration and Next.js.

## What FLIP does:
- Logs in automatically (no more "session expired")
- Scrapes and organizes your PDFs, grades, schedules, and more
- Gives you a clean UI that won’t give you PTSD
- Optional: Notifies you of updates (because CLIP won't)

## Why FLIP?
Because CLIP sucks.
